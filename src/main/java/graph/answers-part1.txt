## Part 1

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

I included three constructor in my Graph. One is to create a empty Graph with no Vertex existed in
the Graph. One is to create a Graph with a starter Vertex. One is to create a Graph with a relationship
between Vertices and Edges which store in a Map. I included four methods, getEdgesFrom(), getEdgesTo(),
getAdjacencyList(), addEdge(), in my Graph. getEdgesFrom() is used to get the parents Edges for a Vertex.
getEdgesTo() is used to get the children Edges for a Vertex. getAdjacencyList() is used to get the
relationship Map between Vertices and Edges. addEdge() is used to add new edge into this graph. I override
two methods, which are hashCode() and equals(). Because the Graph can have consistency, we need to make
sure hashCode() and equals() can express the consistency when two Graphs are the same.

Also, I included inner class Vertex and Edge. It is too complicated to include all the relationship of
parents and children in Graph. So I store the relationship in Vertex and store the origin and destination
for an Edge in Edge instead.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

My testing strategy is to test every method or function I wrote in the skeleton code. I try to test
my Graph's function in script tests with a big picture, like can it create a new graph, can it add node,
can it show children Node. I try to make sure every method I try to write can be tested in JUnit. For
example, I test creating a new empty graph in script test, and now I will test creating a new graph
with other constructor. They tend to complement each other.
